Maximum Pairwise Product
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Description:
++++++++++++++
Given a list of integers, your task is to find the maximum pairwise product of any two numbers in the list.
The pairwise product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them. For example, the pairwise product of a and b is a * b.
You need to determine the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying two different numbers from the list.

Input:
++++++++
1. An integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list.
2. A list of n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (−10^9 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the list.

Output:
++++++++++
1. A single integer, the maximum pairwise product of two distinct elements from the list.

Constraints:
+++++++++++++
1. The list has at least two elements.
2. All numbers can be either positive or negative, so the result can also be negative, zero, or positive.
Y2. our solution should be optimized for time complexity, as the input size can be large.

Note:
+++++++
1. The brute force solution would check all pairs of numbers and compute their product, but this has a time complexity of O(n^2). To improve performance, try finding an optimized approach.
2. In many cases, the two largest positive numbers or two smallest negative numbers (which, when multiplied, may yield a large positive product) will provide the maximum product.
